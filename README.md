## CI/CD Tutorial

If you'd like to see how to set up the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and how to create a [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)/CD pipeline to deploy this web app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), see the beginner-friendly tutorial: [Build a continous deployment pipeline with Travis CI](https://www.split.io/blog/java-continuous-deployment-tutorial/).

The tutorial also covers setting up a feature flag in [Split UI](https://app.split.io) to enable the location selection feature, and to easily implement safe rollouts and instant rollbacks.
